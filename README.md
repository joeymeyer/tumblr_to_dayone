# Tumblr to Day One

A simple command prompt that easily allows you to add posts from a [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) blog to your [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) journal.

## Usage

Get started by installing the gem:

    $ gem install tumblr_to_dayone

You will also need to install the [Day One CLI](http://dayoneapp.com/tools/).

After that you are ready to go:

    $ tumblr_to_dayone
    
This command starts a prompt and asks a few questions to get things setup:

* Name of the blog
* Password (if there is one)
* Automatically add all posts â€“ or choose which ones to add one by one
* Path to your Day One journal (leave blank if it's the default path)

After that it is ready to go and will start pulling down your Tumblr posts to either add one by one or all at once.
